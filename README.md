This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio â€” a minimalist, performance-focused site designed to showcase my background, selected projects, and technical capabilities.

- Accessible, WCAG-compliant design
- Optimized for fast load times and low bandwidth
- Fully self-hostable with no external dependencies
- Dark-mode compatible

## Technologies

To deploy via GitHub Pages:

1. Push to `main` branch
2. Enable Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to `/root` or `/docs` as needed
